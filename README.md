## How To Play
"Walk-in Order" is a game where you will walk through mazes with colored blocks, 
which you have to step in order as stated on the top of your screen. Failure to do so
means you have to restart the level all over again at the beginning. As you advance through
the game, more colors will be introduced and more challenging mazes will follow.

Press K to start the game!

## Controls
- Press W, A, S, D to move your character up, left, down, right, respectively.
- Press J if you are stuck and want to re-start the same level all over again.
- From now on, ONLY press K IF you want to start again at Level 0,
this is for use only if you for some reason want to reset, or have finished the whole game.

## Remarks
- You are allowed to step in a colored block, and get out on the same side you entered in.
- You, however, are not allowed to step on the block of same color again after leaving one.
